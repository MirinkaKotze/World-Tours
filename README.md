Beetroot Academy - Lesson 02

Create a table with different items.

Each item should have a image, link to a youtube video, input fields, a button and a slider.
When clicking on the youtube link, it should take you to the video and start playing.

You can choose our own theme and content for the table.

The table should have a slider and the header of the table should stick when you scroll through the table items.
